How does CleanMyPC 1.8.8.962 compare with other PC cleaners and optimizers? According to some reviews, CleanMyPC has some advantages and disadvantages that you should consider before buying it.
 
One of the advantages of CleanMyPC is that it has a simple, easy-to-navigate interface that lets you access all the tools with a few clicks[^1^]. It also has a useful file shredder and program uninstaller that can help you get rid of unwanted files and applications permanently[^1^]. Moreover, CleanMyPC can protect your online privacy by deleting your browser's cache, cookies, and history[^1^] [^2^].
 
However, CleanMyPC also has some drawbacks that might make you think twice. For example, it lacks a back-up tool that can help you restore your system in case something goes wrong[^1^]. It also doesn't supply detailed information about the software it wants to uninstall, which might cause you to remove something important by mistake[^1^]. Furthermore, CleanMyPC is not very cheap compared to some of its competitors, such as Iolo System Mechanic or Ashampoo WinOptimizer[^3^].
 
Therefore, if you are looking for a PC cleaner and optimizer that can improve your system performance and free up disk space, CleanMyPC 1.8.8.962 might be a good option for you. However, if you want more features, more information, and more value for your money, you might want to look elsewhere.
